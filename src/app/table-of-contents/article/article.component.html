    Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
    Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries
    that
    you import into your apps.
  </p>

  <p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are <em>NgModules</em>, which provide a compilation context for
    <em>components</em>. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of
    NgModules. An app always has at least a <em>root module</em> that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more
    <em>feature modules</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Components define <em>views</em>, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify
        according to your program logic and data. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Components use <em>services</em>, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service
        providers can be <em>injected</em> into components as <em>dependencies</em>, making your code modular, reusable,
        and efficient.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with <em>decorators</em> that mark their type and provide metadata
    that tells Angular how to use them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The metadata for a component class associates it with a <em>template</em> that defines a view. A template
        combines ordinary HTML with Angular <em>directives</em> and <em>binding markup</em> that allow Angular to modify
        the HTML before rendering it for display.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components
        through <em>dependency injection (DI)</em>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the
    <code><a href="api/router/Router" class="code-anchor">Router</a></code> service to help you define navigation paths
    among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>

  <h2>Modules</h2>

  <p>
    Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context
    for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of
    capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional
    units.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every Angular app has a root module, conventionally named AppModule, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that
    launches the application. An app typically contains many functional modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality
    to
    be exported and used by other NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the Router
    NgModule.
  </p>
  <p>
    Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing development of complex applications, and in
    designing for reusability. In addition, this technique lets you take advantage of lazy-loading—that is, loading
    modules on demand—to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.
  </p>

  <h2>Components</h2>
  <p>
    Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy with
    the
    page document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is
    associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The @Component() decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides the template and
    related component-specific metadata.
  </p>


  <h3>Templates, directives, and data binding</h3>
  <p>A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements before they are displayed.
    Template <em>directives</em> provide program logic, and <em>binding markup</em> connects your application data and
    the DOM.
    There are two types of data binding:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Event binding</em> lets your app respond to user input in the target environment by updating your
      application data.</li>
    <li><em>Property binding</em> lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application data into the
      HTML.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before a view is displayed, Angular evaluates the directives and resolves the binding syntax in the template to
    modify the HTML elements and the DOM, according to your program data and logic. Angular supports <em>two-way data
      binding</em>, meaning that changes in the DOM, such as user choices, are also reflected in your program data.</p>
  <p>Your templates can use <em>pipes</em> to improve the user experience by transforming values for display.
    For example, use pipes to display dates and currency values that are appropriate for a user's locale.
    Angular provides predefined pipes for common transformations, and you can also define your own pipes.</p>

  <h2 id="section4">Services and dependency injection</h2>
  <p>For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you
    create a <em>service</em> class. A service class definition is immediately preceded by the
    <code>@<a href="api/core/Injectable" class="code-anchor">Injectable</a>()</code> decorator. The decorator provides
    the metadata that allows other providers to be <strong>injected</strong> as dependencies into your class.</p>
  <p> <em>Dependency injection</em> (DI) lets you keep your component classes lean and efficient. They don't fetch data
    from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the console; they delegate such tasks to services.</p>
